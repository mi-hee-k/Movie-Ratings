            <h2>The Shawshank Redemption</h2>
            <p>
              Framed in the 1940s for the double murder of his wife and her
              lover, upstanding banker Andy Dufresne begins a new life at the
              Shawshank prison, where he puts his accounting skills to work for
              an amoral warden. During his long stretch in prison, Dufresne
              comes to be admired by the other inmates -- including an older
              prisoner named Red -- for his integrity and unquenchable sense of
              hope.
